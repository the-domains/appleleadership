My name is Scott Greer and I am a PhD student at Alliant International University. I am studying the concept of leadership and I am fascinated and intrigued by Apple. Because of this and my desire to tie my work to something that interests me, I have decided to look at different events and leadership decisions with Apple using academic models and concepts. 

My belief is that Apple is a unique corporation that has the ability to change more than just the technology it creates, but the entire world of business by leading in its practices. Far too often, I have heard as I have traveled through school, "that's just how Apple does it. No one else can do it that way." I disagree. I believe by not studying this company closer, many corporations and organizations are not reaching the full potential their companies have to offer.
If leaders of today's organizations can at least be open to the possibility that what Apple does is not only make great products, but also create a culture where innovation can thrive. I believe that innovation and excellence is what all effective leaders strive for within organizations. 

I hope that as you begin to read this blog, my words will help expand mental horizons on the possibilities of what Apple does as a company. I believe the tactics are more than just luck, marketing, and slick products. I believe that engendered in the entire culture is the belief that Apple can change the world through what it does. As an outsider looking in, I believe that Apple can. I believe that this company has the opportunity to do what no other has done in the past by creating not technological changes and also social changes that will alter the course of human history. 

You might scoff at the boldness of my prediction, but I believe this. And I hope with my words, I can help enlighten others to understand why this is possible.
I also wish to be able to use the information I'm gathering and apply at something that I am very interested in. I am hoping this will make my doctoral studies go by in a more enjoyable way. So welcome to my mind. Thank you for reading.
